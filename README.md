# webapp-enhancements
Some bookmarklets and user scripts to enhance your development workflow.

## Bookmarklets

You can build a bookmarklet by calling `npm run build`. It will become accessible in its _dist_ directory as _bookmarklet.html_.

### jira-list-value

A blookmarklet script which lists your issue values within a date range on JIRA. Get it [here](/src/jira-list-value/dist/bookmarklet.html).

(Note: most likely you'll have to update the field name representing the monetary value to match your JIRA setup - the default is "customfield_10025".)
